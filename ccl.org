#+title: BeagleBone Black - Open Embedded CCL Recipe Notes

  These are internal notes to self.

* Objective

  To bring up a clozure common lisp (ccl) image on the beaglebone
  black.  I don't think it's possible to do this with a standard
  x-compile, like the other software since ccl bootstraps itself,
  we need it running on that platform.

 I've built the thing under oe, but I can't run the bootstrap process
 per the ccl documenation because the image is of the wrong type.
 That needs to be executed on the target.  Another way of saying it,
 is CCL can't target the bootstrap to another platform.

 - [ ] Boot into the image, and run the bootstrap processes
 - [ ] Save binary back to build machine
 - [ ] Check binary in, the recipe simply pulls the binary
