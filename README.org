#+title: BeagleBone Black - Open Embedded Notes
#+author: Eric Gustafson

* Objective
  To automate the building and deploying of a beagle bone black image
  that has a fully functional ccl development environment.
  
  Implement a hotspot that dishes out segmented networks that won't
  allow cross talk between networks.  

** Use Cases

*** Profile based Isolation

**** IOT Isolation
   My smart tv will only be allowed to access a single remote server
   with an outbound connection.  No other device on the network will be 
   allowed to send it IP packets.

**** Untrusted device isolation
     My tablets and smart phones won't be able to access any other
     devices on the network.  The may only talk to the larger
     Internet.

** Functional Milestones
   - [X] Successful bbb-oe image
   - [X] Compile a working image of ccl
   - [ ] publish ccl beaglebone black image on github page.
   - [ ] Replace my openwrt router
   - [ ] DHCP server dishing out isolated networks
   - [ ] Scanning information, rudimentary GUI
   - [ ] Lost mode and commissioning prototype
   - [ ] OTA firmware upgrades
